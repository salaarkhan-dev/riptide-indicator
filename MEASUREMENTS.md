# Measurements

Every strategy question tested on this project, what came back, and what was
done about it. Written down because most of these came back negative, and a
negative result nobody recorded gets re-tested in a month.

## Method

Unless stated otherwise: 50 MEXC USDT perpetuals ranked by 24h turnover,
2000 `Min30` bars (41.6 days), the engine's shipped `Cfg`.

Each signal is scored as a trade: a limit at the entry, fillable for 10 bars
from the bar the setup became **detectable**; the alerted stop; a fixed target;
stop taken first when one bar contains both; marked to market at the close
after 60 bars. A setup that never fills scores **0R**, so fill rate cannot be
gamed by moving the entry somewhere price never returns.

Comparisons between entry variants are **paired** on the same setups, which is
why their standard errors are far smaller than the levels they compare.

Two things are never modelled, and both flatter every number below: **fees and
slippage**. A ~0.06% round trip is ~0.04R at 1.5% risk and ~0.10R at 0.6%, so
the tighter-stop variants are hurt most.

## The one thing that worked

**Daily SuperTrend(14, 5) filter.** 2026 setups, 1R target:

| | setups | R per setup |
|---|---|---|
| with the daily trend | 1011 | **+0.103 ± 0.021** |
| against the daily trend | 1015 | −0.008 ± 0.020 |
| difference | | **+0.110 ± 0.029 (+3.8 SE)** |

It is the only result that has replicated: the gap came back at **+0.135,
+0.095 and +0.110** across two windows, two symbol sets and two scoring
methods. The level it sits on has ranged from −0.05 to +0.32 over the same
comparisons.

**Trust the separation, not the level.** Shipped as a label on every alert
rather than a filter, so counter-trend signals are judged rather than hidden.
`/trend on` suppresses them.

## Two bugs that invalidated earlier numbers

**Lookahead in every backtest.** `scan_leg` searches for the entry gap
backwards from the raid, so the gap often forms *before* the shift that makes
the setup detectable — 56% of the time, median 4 bars earlier, up to 41.
Scoring from the gap bar counted fills from bars that had already closed
before the setup existed. Correcting it cost **0.229 R per setup (−22 SE)**,
larger than any effect these tests were built to detect. Every figure on this
page is post-correction.

**The freshness gate measured from the wrong bar.** It aged a setup from the
shift, not from when it became knowable, so any setup whose gap took more than
a bar to arrive was found, recorded, deduped and never sent — 76 of 2035 (4%),
permanently. Both bugs were the same mistake about when a setup starts
existing.

## Tested and rejected

Everything here is a paired comparison against the shipped entry unless noted.

### Entry placement

| variant | 1R | 3R | fill | median risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FVG entry, raid stop (shipped)** | +0.056 ± 0.016 | +0.041 ± 0.025 | 50% | 1.61% |
| Order Block (full candle), raid stop | +0.079 ± 0.014 | +0.047 ± 0.023 | 37% | 1.17% |
| Order Block (full candle), OB stop | +0.085 ± 0.014 | +0.045 ± 0.025 | 37% | 0.62% |
| Order Block (body), raid stop | +0.073 ± 0.013 | +0.052 ± 0.022 | 32% | 1.03% |

Paired: **+1.6, +1.6, +1.1 SE at 1R; +0.3, +0.1, +0.5 SE at 3R.** Across six
comparisons, one at 1.6 SE is what noise produces. Trend-aligned — the only
bucket that has ever separated — the shipped entry is **best** (+0.103 against
+0.096, +0.069, +0.068), so the nominal advantage lives entirely in the half
worth least. An OB exists for essentially every setup (0 of 1899 lacked one),
so it cannot act as a filter.

| variant | 1R | 3R | fill | median risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FVG entry, raid stop (shipped)** | +0.059 ± 0.018 | +0.040 ± 0.029 | 55% | 1.50% |
| Breaker (candle), raid stop | +0.058 ± 0.017 | +0.034 ± 0.028 | 47% | 1.26% |
| Breaker (candle), breaker stop | +0.079 ± 0.017 | +0.031 ± 0.030 | 47% | 0.64% |
| Breaker (body), raid stop | +0.068 ± 0.016 | +0.048 ± 0.026 | 40% | 1.08% |

Paired: **−0.1, +0.9, +0.5 SE at 1R; −0.2, −0.2, +0.3 SE at 3R.** Trend-aligned,
the shipped entry is best again (+0.110 against +0.081, +0.064, +0.085).

The breaker here is the opposing candle whose extreme the shift broke, which
is distinct from the Order Block above (anchored to the impulse that made the
gap). Both land in the same place.

**Lower-timeframe entry** (`Min15` gap on a `Min30` structure), 816 paired
setups: filled 85% against 45% and scored the same, **−0.020 R (−0.4 SE)**.
Filling twice as often produced proportionally more wins *and* more losses.

All three move the entry along one axis — deeper fills less often at better
prices, shallower fills more often at worse ones — and all three net out. That
axis appears to be genuinely flat on this data.

**Watch the tight-stop variants.** The best-looking rows (OB/breaker with the
zone stop) have ~0.6% risk against the baseline's ~1.5%. Fees cost ~0.10R there
versus ~0.04R, so most of the apparent gain is a bill not yet paid.

### Exits

1006 trend-aligned setups:

| exit | R per setup | paired vs 1R |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0R, no break-even | +0.103 ± 0.022 | — |
| 1.5R, arm 1.0R, lock 0.1R | +0.103 ± 0.025 | +0.000 (+0.0 SE) |
| 2.0R, arm 1.0R, lock 0.1R | +0.102 ± 0.027 | −0.001 (−0.1 SE) |
| 3.0R, arm 1.5R, lock 0.1R | +0.116 ± 0.034 | +0.013 (+0.5 SE) |

Nothing separates. An earlier run of this same comparison found the far target
clearly worst and the ordering perfectly monotonic; on a later window with the
lookahead corrected, 3R is nominally **best**. That ranking was one window's
noise read as a result — it is the clearest illustration on this page of why a
confident-looking backtest number is not a finding.

**Trailing stops**, 1374 trend-aligned setups, five families: ATR(14)×2 from
entry −1.3 SE, ATR×2 armed at 1R +1.1 SE, 2-bar structure trail at 1R +0.6 SE.
All inside noise. Trailing from entry is nominally worst — a 2×ATR band sits
inside the normal retracement of a post-sweep move.

### Filters and sources

**Session timing**, using the reference indicator's own GMT+0 windows
(London 08–17, NY 13–22, Asia 00–09), 2000 setups in six exclusive buckets:

| window | all setups |
|---|---|
| Asia only 00-08 | +0.071 ± 0.026 (689) |
| Asia + London 08-09 | +0.179 ± 0.062 (113) |
| London only 09-13 | +0.030 ± 0.040 (297) |
| London + NY 13-17 | +0.075 ± 0.031 (451) |
| NY only 17-22 | −0.020 ± 0.039 (320) |
| outside all 22-00 | +0.018 ± 0.061 (130) |

Best minus worst is +2.7 SE, but that is the max-minus-min of **six** buckets,
which produces ~2–2.5 SE from noise alone — and the winner is a single hour
with the smallest sample. Rejected.

**Pool source:**

| pool | sweeps | setups | converts | R per setup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pivot | 6114 | 1686 | 28% | +0.048 ± 0.017 |
| Day | 3286 | 311 | 9% | +0.094 ± 0.035 |
| Week | 295 | **0** | **0%** | — |

Day beats Pivot by +1.2 SE, which is nothing. Note that **conversion rate and
profitability are different questions** — Pivot converts three times as often
and scores no better per setup. Conflating the two once led to a wrong ranking
of what to build next.

**Week pools are the one actionable result on this page.** 295 sweeps produced
zero setups in 41.6 days. By the rule of three that bounds their conversion
below ~1%, against Pivot's 28%. They cost sweep alerts and return nothing —
see `RIPTIDE_USE_WEEKLY` in `riptide.conf`.

### Engine parameters

Six variants covering the reference indicator's own settings — `pivot_right`,
`tol_atr`, `max_overshoot_atr`, `max_bars_after_grab` — all inside noise.

`max_bars_after_mss = 5` (against 10) drops 55 of 2034 setups and alters none.
Those 55 nominally scored better (+0.319 against +0.044), but on 55 samples
that is not readable. Reverted: the count reduction is certain, the quality
claim is not, and suppressing them would foreclose the live measurement that
could settle it.

## Confluence — the one open question

The tests above asked whether an Order Block or Breaker is a *better entry
price* than the gap. Flat, three times over. They never asked whether the zones
**agreeing** grades a setup, which is a different question and the more natural
use for them: keep the shipped entry, and score the alert by how many other
zones sit in the same price area.

1982 setups that had both an order block and a breaker:

| zones agreeing with the gap | all setups | trend-aligned | 3R |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 of 2 | +0.043 ± 0.019 (1232) | +0.082 ± 0.028 | +0.032 ± 0.030 |
| 1 of 2 | +0.035 ± 0.032 (388) | +0.104 ± 0.045 | +0.042 ± 0.051 |
| 2 of 2 | **+0.106 ± 0.039** (362) | **+0.170 ± 0.057** | +0.064 ± 0.063 |

2 minus 0 is **+1.4 SE**. Taken alone:

| | agrees | does not | |
|---|---|---|---|
| Order block overlaps the gap | +0.096 ± 0.030 (542) | +0.037 ± 0.018 (1440) | +1.7 SE |
| Breaker overlaps the gap | +0.067 ± 0.030 (570) | +0.047 ± 0.018 (1412) | +0.6 SE |

And by how far the order block sits from the gap entry, in ATR: Q1 (0.00–0.24)
+0.090, Q2 +0.045, Q3 (0.51–0.99) +0.017, Q4 +0.059.

**Not a finding.** +1.4 to +1.7 SE across four framings is roughly what the
maximum of four tests produces from noise, and the primary is **not monotonic**
— 1 of 2 came in *below* 0 of 2, which a real effect should not do. The
trend-aligned column is monotonic and the OB-distance quartiles agree with the
OB-overlap result, so two roughly independent framings point the same way. That
is more than any rejected variant above managed, and still not enough.

So it ships the only way an uncertain signal should: **as a label, never as a
filter.** Every alert carries `●●` / `●○` / `○○`, no setup is suppressed, and
`outcomes.confluence` lets `/stats` split live results by it. If the effect is
real it will show up out of sample; if it is the fourth false positive on this
page, nothing was lost but a line of text.

Note also that the breaker contributes almost nothing on its own (+0.6 SE) —
if this survives, the order block is doing the work.

## The grade on each alert

Two lines on the alert — a trend note and a zone count — asked the reader to
combine them. They are now one graded line, with the bands read off the joint
cells rather than invented:

| | 0 zones | 1 zone | 2 zones |
|---|---|---|---|
| **with the trend** | +0.083 (620) | +0.109 (188) | **+0.170 (173)** |
| **against** | +0.001 (625) | −0.025 (204) | +0.047 (189) |

Every with-trend cell beats every against-trend cell, and within with-trend the
confluence ordering is monotonic — which is what makes a ladder defensible:

| grade | | share of alerts | measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **A+** | with the trend · gap, order block and breaker agree | 9% | +0.170 ± 0.057 |
| 🟢 **A** | with the trend · gap and order block agree | 9% | +0.109 ± 0.045 |
| 🟡 **B** | with the trend | 31% | +0.083 ± 0.028 |
| 🟠 **C** | against the trend | 50% | +0.008 |
| ⚪ **?** | trend unknown | rare | — |

**Read the steps honestly.** Only the **B/C step is established** — that is the
trend filter, +0.110 ± 0.029, +3.8 SE, replicated three times. **A+ over B is
+0.087 ± 0.064, which is +1.4 SE and not significant**, and against the trend
the confluence ordering breaks down entirely (1 zone scores *below* 0 zones).

So B versus C is a real distinction; A+ versus A versus B is a hypothesis being
tracked live. Four bands rather than ten because the data cannot resolve ten,
and no band is a prediction about any single trade — C averages roughly zero,
not a loss.

Nothing is suppressed by grade. `/stats` reports by grade so live data settles
the top of the ladder, and grades are computed from the stored `trend_dir` and
`confluence` columns rather than stored themselves — so revising the ladder
re-grades history instead of stranding it.

## What this adds up to

Tested: six engine parameters, two entry timeframes, five exit families, four
targets, Order Block entries (four variants), Breaker Block entries (four
variants), session timing (six buckets), pool source. **Every one came back
inside noise.** One thing has ever separated, and it keeps replicating.

The reasonable conclusion is not that these need testing more carefully. It is
that the structural variations genuinely do not matter much on this data, and
the remaining headroom is not in another entry *price*.

Zone confluence is the one live candidate, at +1.4 SE — shipped as a score
rather than a filter, precisely because that is not enough to act on.

## The standing caveat

Everything above shares one 41.6-day window, on symbols chosen by their
turnover *today* — survivorship bias, one regime, no out-of-sample data. The
trend-filter estimate moved 35% in a few hours of fresh candles. A confident
monotonic exit ranking evaporated on the next window.

That is what `riptide/tracker.py` exists for. `/stats` scores live alerts
forward from the moment they fire, out of sample, in whatever regime actually
occurs. At ~39 entry signals a day across two strategies, a thin read takes
about 10 days and one that could see a 0.1R difference about 52.

**Where live data disagrees with this page, believe the live data.**
